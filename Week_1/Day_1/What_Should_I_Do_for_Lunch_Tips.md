### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`,`>`,`===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log('hungry is', hungry);
  console.log('availableTime is', availableTime);
}
```

To push things to a git repo from the terminal you need to make sure you generate a token. This is done from your git hub users settings under the feild:

- `developer settings`.

From there you'll need to decide which accesses this key will allow permisions to and if you want to designate an expirey date.

### `BE SURE TO SAVE THE KEY INFORMATION SOMEWHERE SAFE!!`

You'll need this key when you want to push your updates to the repo.
